## Documentation for Amazon Developer Portal

This site contains documentation for some of the pages on the Amazon Developer Portal (https://developer.amazon.com/). Currently, only a small subset of the Developer Portal docs are in this repo (mainly Fire TV, Fire App Builder, and Fling), but the plan is to expand the amount of documentation on Github in the future. We want our documentation to be more community-oriented, interactive, accurate, and thorough.

## Pull Requests

The documentation is available on Github to encourage both internal and external developers to improve the docs. You can click the pencil button ("Edit") to make updates to existing pages, or click **Create new file** to add new content entirely. Submit these changes through the standard pull request workflow.

Note that when you make an update to the docs, Github will fork the repo in your own Github account. When you save the update, you'll be prompted to submit the pull request.

When we receive your pull request (PR), we'll either merge it or make requests for changes. After PRs are merged, they move into an internal publishing pipeline that is separate from Github.

If you want to build the project from your Github fork, you can do so. You can build the site with Jekyll by running `jekyll serve`. (Note that the Jekyll theme is only a convenience for previewing the site and doesn't show the current Dev Portal doc theme. In the future we'll probably make these displays the same.)

## Log Issues

You can also log documentation issues on the Issues tab. This is helpful if you know there's an issue or need an update about something, but you don't want to make the change directly yourself.
