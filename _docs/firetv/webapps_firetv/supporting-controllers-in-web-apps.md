Amazon Fire TV supports user input from the Amazon Fire TV remote, the Amazon Fire game controller, and other game controllers that support the Bluetooth HID gamepad profile. These controllers give users a means of navigating in your app and selecting items.

## Using Input from the Amazon Fire TV Remote {#usinginput}

Most Amazon Fire TV remote controls have these buttons. Some Fire TV remotes do not include the microphone or voice search buttons.

{% include image.html file="firetv/getting_started/images/remote-callouts" type="png" alt="Remote control" caption="Remote control" %}

{% include content/{{site.language}}/fire/firetvedition_remote_note.md %}

To enable users to interact with your web app by using the remote, you need to capture the key events when users press one of the keys. Most key presses can be captured just as standard keyboard events in a browser.

For keycode mappings, see the following table. The **Back**, **Home**, **Menu**, and **Voice Search** buttons cannot be captured. For a workaround that allows customizing **Back** button behavior with HTML5 web apps, see the [Fire TV Web Apps FAQ][fire-tv-web-app-faq].

    <tr>
      <td>Up (D-Pad)</td>
      <td>38</td>
      <td>Moves the focus upward in the user interface.</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Moves the focus downward in the user interface.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>37</td>
      <td>Moves the focus left in the user interface.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right (D-Pad)</td>
      <td>39</td>
      <td>Moves the focus right in the user interface.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Play/Pause</td>
      <td>179</td>
      <td>Controls media playback. Play/Pause is a toggle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rewind</td>
      <td>227</td>
      <td>Rewinds or skips backwards in media playback contexts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fast Forward</td>
      <td>228</td>
      <td>Fast Forwards or skips ahead in media playback contexts. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Back</td>
      <td>NA</td>
      <td>Navigates back in the history stack.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These key events are sent only to apps that are in focus.

## Using Input from the Amazon Fire Game Controller {#using_input}

Developing for the Amazon Fire Game Controller is straightforward:

*  Amazon WebView supports the W3C standard [Gamepad](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html) APIs.
*  The buttons on the Amazon Fire Game Controller map to the standard gamepad format.
*  In using the Gamepad APIs with the Amazon Fire Game Controller, the **Back** button is equivalent to **Select** on a standard controller, and the **Menu** button is equivalent to **Start**. If you do not use the Gamepad APIs, the buttons behave as **Back** and **Menu** buttons.

For more information on developing for the Standard Gamepad APIs, see [Jumping the Hurdles with the Gamepad API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/).

If you choose not to use the Gamepad APIs, the buttons on the Amazon Fire Game Controller generally map to the same functions as on the Amazon Fire TV Remote (other than the **B** button).

The Amazon Fire TV (Gen 2) Game Controller has these buttons:

The Amazon Fire TV (1st Generation) Game Controller has these buttons:

{% include image.html file="firetv/getting_started/images/gamepad-callouts-second-view" type="png" title="Game controller, other buttons" %}

## Play/Pause Media Button

A requirement for all media apps submitted for Fire TV is that they handle the media **Play/Pause** key events to control media playback. All Game applications must also handle the media **Play/Pause** key events to play or pause the game. The key code for the **Play/Pause** button is 179.

{% include note.html content="The button is a toggle. If the app is paused the  **Play/Pause** button should start the app. If the app is running, the **Play/Pause** button should pause it." %}
