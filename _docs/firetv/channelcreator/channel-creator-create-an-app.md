For more information about Channel Creator, see the [Overview][channel-creator-overview].

To create an app:

1.  Create an Amazon developer account through the Developer Portal at [developer.amazon.com/](https://developer.amazon.com/). Click **Sign In**, and then select **I am a new customer.**

    Your Amazon developer account is different from your retail Amazon account (though for the sake of simplicity, you should use the same username for both). From the Developer Portal, you can manage your app submissions, update descriptions and other metadata about your app, see reports about downloads, and view other details about your app.

    {% include note.html content="The [Channel Creator site](https://channelcreator.amazon.com/) allows you to create and submit your app entirely from its site, but you can also download the zip file Channel Creator produces and submit it through the Developer Portal manually. "%}

2.  Go to Channel Creator at [channelcreator.amazon.com/](https://channelcreator.amazon.com/) and sign in with your Amazon developer account.
3.  Click **Create New Channel**.
4.  Select the source for your videos:
    * YouTube
    * Media RSS feed

    See the following section, [YouTube versus Media RSS Feeds](#youtube_vs_mrss) for pros and cons between the two options.
5.  If you selected **YouTube**, enter your Channel ID in the text box. See [Get Your YouTube Channel ID][channel-creator-youtube#getchannelid] for details.

    Channel Creator attempts to validate the username or channel ID, or the MRSS feed. If successful, you see a green check mark. Skip to step 7.

6.  If you selected **Media RSS**, enter your MRSS feed URL in the text box. See [Sample Media RSS Feed][channel-creator-mrss#samplemrssfeed] for details.

    Channel Creator attempts to validate the MRSS feed. 

6.  Click **Create**.
