After you [create your app][channel-creator-create-your-app], your app appears under "Manage Channels" in Channel Creator's navigation bar.

When you submit your app, Channel Creator attempts to auto-create some of these image assets, but not all image assets are available from your YouTube channel or MRSS feed. As a result, you will need to manually upload some image assets. The submission details will also require you to add a description for your app, select keywords, choose a category, and acknowledge policy adherence.

## Submit Your App

1.  Click **Manage Channels**.
2.  Click **Edit** next to your app.
3.  Click **Finish**.
4.  Click **Submit**. (Note that if you already have a submission in progress, you must wait until the Submission is approved before submitting your app again.)

    Channel Creator prepares your app for submission by auto-creating some screenshots and populating other submission details, such as your title and categories, from your YouTube channel or MRSS feed.

    See the following sections for details about the required image assets and descriptions.

5.  After completing the required image and description sections, click **Submit** to publish your app. You receive an email from the Appstore confirming that your app was submitted. When the app is live, you receive another email.

## Image Assets Required for Submission {#imageassets}

You need to prepare image assets of various sizes. These images are used to promote your app in the Fire TV Appstore and the Amazon Appstore website.

To change the images shown in the Channel Creator interface, click the images and upload new ones.

{% include note.html content="Channel Creator has a 2MB file-size limit on uploads. To upload 1920px x 1080px screenshots, you will likely need to use JPG format and potentially some compression (such as 95%)." %}

Details for each image asset are provided in the following tabs:

- note that you change the images by clicking them. this is a bit unintuitive in the UI.

## Increasing Visibility for Your App

Getting your app into the Appstore is just the first step. For your app to be successful, you'll need to promote your app as much as possible. The [Amazon Developer blog](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs) often publishes tips on marketing. See the following posts:

Sending recommendations to the \"Recommended By Your Apps Row\" can get your content on the user's home screen so they are more likely to engage with your app." %}


## Delete Your App from the Appstore

Apps you submit to the Appstore can't be deleted -- they can only be suppressed. If you want to suppress your app from the Appstore:

1.  Click **Manage Channels**.
2.  Click **Delete**, and then confirm the removal.

It can take 1-2 days for your app to be fully suppressed from the Appstore.

suppressed differs from delete? why?
