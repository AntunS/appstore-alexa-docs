**Design Best Practices**:

<span class="bestPractices">DO:</span>

* *Use cinematic imagery.* Use imagery that is engaging and has a pleasing composition.
* *Use balance.* Use imagery that has a sufficient amount of white space.
* *Use depth.* Varying depths of field in the image will provide a good backdrop.
* *Use character-centric imagery.* Use imagery that includes major characters.
* *Place subject right.* The main subject should be to the right side of the image when possible.

<span class="bestPractices">DO NOT:</span>

* *Place subject left.* The main subject should not be on the left side because the UI may obscure it.
* *Crop heads and faces.* Use the safe zones to verify placement of heads and faces.
* *Embed logos or titles.* Logos and titles should not be in the background.
* *Use busy imagery.* Do not use imagery that has too many subjects or fine detail.
