**Content Safe Area**

Screenshots aren't covered by badging, so you don't have to worry about placing content inside a safe area.

**Design Best Practices**:

<span class="bestPractices">DO:</span>

* *Use cinematic imagery.* Use imagery that is engaging and has a pleasing composition.
* *Use different scenes.* Use screen stills that display different scenes of the app.
* *Use character-centric imagery.* Use imagery that includes major characters or notable content.
* *Show logical progression.* Highlight the app’s most interesting features in a logical progression that mimics a typical user’s experience. Begin at the broadest area of user interaction (for example, the main menu), comprehensively document the app’s main feature(s), and explore the app’s peripheral features, menus, and settings.
* *Focus on core functionality.* Focus on the app’s core functionality, while touching on one or two of its less prominent features.

<span class="bestPractices">DO NOT:</span>

* *Use contextual imagery.* Do not use photographs of someone using the app. Only show the app itself.
* *Display wrong platform.* Screenshots should reflect the app experience on the TV and not additional devices.
* *Show personal information.* If your screenshots will display personal information (such as account names, login information, or social networks), populate the fields with dummy information.
