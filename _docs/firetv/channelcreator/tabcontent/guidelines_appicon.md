The App Icon appears within a row of other App Icons in the Fire TV user interface:

**Specifications**:

* Size: 1280 x 720px
* Format: PNG (no transparency)

Here's a sample App Icon:

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_appicon2" type="jpg" caption="The App Icon" %}

**Fire TV Context**:

The App Icon appears on Fire TV in the following context:

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_appicon5" type="jpg" caption="The App Icon highlighted" %}

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_appicon1" type="jpg" caption="The App Icon without highlighting" %}

**Content Safe Area**:

The following badges may appear superimposed on the App Icon:

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_appicon3" type="jpg" caption="App icon with badging over the image" %}

To ensure your App Icon looks good even with badging (download icons, progress bars, etc.), place your main subject and title art within the content safe area. Artwork that falls outside of the safe area may be covered by badges.

**Design Best Practices**:

Follow these guidelines when designing your App Icon:

<span class="bestPractices">DO:</span>

* *Use original assets.* App icons should reflect the original developer-submitted assets.
* *Use contrast.* Contrast will make the app icon distinct even when it is scaled down.
* *Use balance.* Use imagery that has a sufficient amount of white space.
* *Use fewer subjects.* Fewer characters in app icons is preferred.

<span class="bestPractices">DO NOT:</span>

* *Use wrong assets.* There should be no marketing slogs or studio badging. Only logos or key art.
* *Make it illegible.* Do not overlap logos on major characters or on a busy background.
* *Apply wrong styling.* Key art should go to the edge of the image. Do not include borders or rounded corners.
