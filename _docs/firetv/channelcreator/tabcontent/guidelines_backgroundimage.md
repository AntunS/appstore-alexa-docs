When users scroll across your app from a browse page, the Background Image appears in the upper-right corner of a mini-detail page.

**Specifications**:

* Size: 1920 x 1080px (landscape)
* Format: JPG or 24-bit PNG (no transparency)

The following is an example of a Background Image:

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background5" type="jpg" caption="Sample Background Image" %}

**Fire TV Context**

The Background Image appears on Fire TV in the following context:

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background2" type="jpg" caption="The Background Image highlighted" %}

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background1" type="jpg" caption="The Background Image without highlighting" %}

When users click your app icon, the Background Image can also fill the entire background.

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background4" type="jpg" caption="The Background Image highlighted" %}

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background3" type="jpg" caption="The Background Image without highlighting" %}


**Content safe area**:

The main focus element of the image must be placed within the content safe area. Artwork that falls outside of the safe area might be covered by UI elements.

{% include image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/guidelines_background_safe" type="jpg" caption="Content safe area for Background Image" url="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/appstore/guidelines_background_safe._TTH_.jpg" %}

<div class="legend">
{% include inline_image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/legend_red" type="jpg" %} Imagery may be clipped here.<br/>
{% include inline_image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/legend_orange" type="jpg" %} Imagery may be obscured by opaque elements.<br/>
{% include inline_image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/legend_yellow" type="jpg" %} Imagery may be obscured by translucent or typographic UI elements.<br/>
{% include inline_image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/legend_green" type="jpg" %} Imagery is safe.<br/>
{% include inline_image.html file="firetv/channelcreator/images/legend_safe_green" type="png" %} The 1214 x 830px area represents where the main subject of the image should be placed.<br/>
</div>

**Design Best Practices**:

<span class="bestPractices">DO:</span>

*  *Use cinematic imagery.* Use imagery that is engaging and has a pleasing composition.
*  *Use relevant imagery.* Use imagery that is relevant to the app experience. Don't show a person using the app, the controller, the TV, or the surrounding room. Just show the app itself.
*  *Use different imagery.* When possible, use different imagery than the app icon.
*  *Use character-centric imagery.* Use imagery that includes major characters or notable content.
*  *Place subject right.* The main subject should be to the right side of the image when possible.

<span class="bestPractices">DO NOT:</span>

* *Place subject left.* The main subject should not be on the left side because the UI may obscure it.
* *Crop heads and faces.* Use the safe zones to verify placement of heads and faces.
* *Embed logos or titles.* Logos and titles should not be in the background.
* *Use busy imagery.* Do not use imagery that has too many subjects or fine detail.
* *Show other platforms.* Amazon Appstore offers many apps that also exist on other platforms (smartphones, tablets, competitor devices). Assets should reflect the experience of the app on Fire TV.
