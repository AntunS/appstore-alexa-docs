Your Small Icon, Large Icon, and Fire TV App Icon should contain the same image and design, more or less. The only difference is that the Fire TV App Icon is rectangular whereas the other images (which are used on the Appstore website) are square.

<b>Small Icon (114px x 114px PNG, no transparency)</b>. The Small Icon is a representative image for display within the Amazon Appstore website.

<b>Large Icon (512px x 512px PNG, no transparency)</b>. The Large Icon is a larger version of the small icon image for use in search results and on product detail pages. This image is scaled and used extensively throughout the Amazon Appstore and on Amazon devices, so it should be of the highest possible quality.
