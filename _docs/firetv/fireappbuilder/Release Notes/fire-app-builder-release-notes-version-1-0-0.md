Version 1.0.0 was released on October 1, 2016.

### New Features

The first release includes a fully functional Java-based Android TV app that can parse media feeds and play media.

The app includes more than a dozen components that allow you to quickly add analytics, in-app purchasing, ads, and media player components in your app. You can also customize the look and feel of your app, including the font, images, colors, and layout, by setting values in XML and JSON files.
