The following are known issues in Fire App Builder:

* **Related content item match list**. Related content matches (which are based on tags in the feed) will match unlimited content if many items have the same tags. (The content matches should have an item limit.)
* **Splash screen loading time.** Loading the feed initially can take some time on splash screen. (The initial load time should be faster.)
