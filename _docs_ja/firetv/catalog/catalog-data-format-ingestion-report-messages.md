A catalog data format (CDF) ingestion report is generated for each [catalog file][integrating-your-catalog-with-fire-tv] that an Amazon Fire TV client uploads to Amazon. The report states whether the catalog file was successfully integrated into Fire TV's universal browse and search. If it was not, the report provides details that explain the failure. The report also provides warnings and suggestions that can be used to improve the file.

This page lists errors, warnings, and suggestions seen in an ingestion report, explains their cause, and suggests a resolution to each situation. For more information on obtaining and using your ingestion report, see [receiving-and-understanding-the-catalog-ingestion-report].

{% include note.html content="This is not a comprehensive list of every message you can see in an ingestion report. Your report can also contain XML validation errors generated by one of our validation tools. The wording of those messages varies according to the specific tool used. The messages are less user-friendly and might look like gibberish to a less technical person. If any message in the report has that effect on you, please consult a developer, IT professional, or your Amazon Business Developer Manager to help with the interpretation and required fix. Performing a catalog file validation _before_ you submit the catalog is both a best practice and a way to make the ingestion reports easier to read. See [Validating the CDF File Against the Schema][about-the-cdf#validating] for more details on file validation." %}

### Requirements

The information on this page is intended to help less technical users who are asked to address these issues, as well as developers in need of a reference. Readers should have at least a basic knowledge of working in an XML file (you know what elements and attributes are and know to close your tags) and be familiar with the information in [receiving-and-understanding-the-catalog-ingestion-report].

### Who Should Fix These Problems?

In general, catalog files are created in one of two ways:

*   Automatically, with metadata information pulled from a media database. This is accomplished through a script or other code that grabs the data on a preordained schedule, transforms it into a CDF-compliant catalog file, and uploads it to your S3 bucket. This is the preferred method because once it's working correctly, it will run without the need for human interaction.
*   Manually, with someone maintaining the catalog file over time.

If your company uses the automated method, some fixes and changes must be made in the source database itself rather than the catalog file. Database access is often restricted to database administrators, so work with them to either allow you access or to make the changes for you. You might also have to work with developers to perfect the code that creates the CDF file from the data.

If your company maintains your catalog manually, access is probably less restrictive.

Be aware that in the case of large catalogs it isn't unusual to see warnings and suggestions that number in the thousands. Normally they're only a handful of warnings, just applied to thousands of entries. These don't tend to be issues that can be fixed through a blanket search-and-replace change. For instance, a suggestion to add cast and crew information to 10,000 entries requires addressing each entry individually. Warnings and suggestions do not prevent your catalog from being used, so if and when you address them depends on your time and resources.

### Conventions Used in This Document

The "CDF file" is the catalog data file you upload to Amazon, upon which the ingestion report is based. It is an XML file that conforms to the [catalog data format (CDF) schema][catalog-data-format-schema-reference]. See [About the Catalog Data Format][about-the-cdf] for details on the file contents.

_**WorkID**_ is the ID of the work element (Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra) in which the issue was found. For instance, in the case of a movie it refers to the value of an ID element under a movie entry in your CDF file. Each message in the ingestion report expands to show the ID of each work that caused that message.

**Detail message** is the additional text you'll see for each _WorkID_ when you expand a particular error, warning, or suggestion in the report. It provides more specific information about the message's cause in relation to that work. Not all messages have detail messages, in which case you only see the _WorkID_.

Nested elements are given using a period notation. For instance, TvEpisode.Credits.CrewMember refers to the CrewMember element that is a child of the Credits element that is in turn a child of the TvEpisode element. Movie.ID is an ID element that is the child of a movie element.

Anything in _italics_ not used for emphasis is a placeholder for an actual value; _nn_ for a number, _ss_ for a text string_, url_ for a full URL, etc.

Ellipses (...) used in examples indicate that some material not related to the topic was omitted in the interests of brevity and clarity.

## Errors

Any message in the Errors section of your ingestion report causes your CDF file to be rejected. Correct all reported errors and then resubmit the CDF file.

### Error: Invalid catalog file {#bad_file_parse}

**Detail message**: Unable to parse provided catalog

**What went wrong**

The CDF file is invalid. It's unlikely that you'll see this message; instead, you'll see XML validation failure messages.

**What to do**

Use a tool such as Xmllint or the validation plug-in for Notepad++ to validate your file and point you to errors. An invalid file can be caused by many things: omitting a closing tag, using an undefined element (which can simply be a typo - and also remember that XML is case-sensitive), putting the elements in the wrong order, or not including a required element or attribute. To avoid this error, you should always validate your file _before_ you submit it.

### Error: ID is not unique {#id_not_unique}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ _nn_ works have this ID

**Example:** **tt123456** 6 works have this ID

**What went wrong**

Your file has at least two entries that have the same ID. Each work (Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, etc.) in your CDF file must have a unique ID.

**What to do**

Find each of the works with this ID (tt123456 in the example) in your CDF file. Change the ID for all but one of them, making sure that you generate unique IDs for those you change. If the source of your CDF file is a database, you might use the work's database key as part of its ID to ensure uniqueness. Have an ID scheme and stick to it.

{% include note.html content="When you change an ID, you must also change any references to it. For instance, if you change a TvShow.ID, you will also need to change all of that show's TvSeason.ShowID, TvEpisode.ShowID, TvSpecial.ShowID, or Extra.RelatesToID elements to match." %}

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ID <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *


### Error: MiniSeriesEpisode references an invalid MiniSeriesID {#miniseries_id_invalid}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**Example:** **tt123456** MiniSeriesEpisode references an invalid MiniSeriesID

**What went wrong**

The MiniSeriesEpisode with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) has a MiniSeriesID element, but it's blank.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the MiniSeries element to which this episode should belong. If it is present, note its ID value. Go to the MiniSeriesEpisode's entry, locate its MiniSeriesID element, and change the value to match the MiniSeries ID. That is, ensure that MiniSeries.ID = MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID.

If the MiniSeries element isn't present and you're not going to add it, use MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle instead of MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID. MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle is used as given, without having to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a MiniSeries element. You might also consider whether this work would be more accurately tagged as a TvSpecial.

**Elements possibly involved**

MiniSeries.ID <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle <br/>

* * *

### Error: Referenced MiniSeries not found {#miniseries_not_found}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ MiniSeriesEpisode references a missing MiniSeries with ID of _ss_

**Example:** **tt123456** MiniSeriesEpisode references a missing MiniSeries with ID of nn654321

**What went wrong**

The MiniSeriesEpisode with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) specifies the ID of its MiniSeries (nn654321 in the example), but there's no matching MiniSeries in your catalog.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the MiniSeries element to which this episode should belong. If it is present, note its ID value. Go to the MiniSeriesEpisode's entry, locate its MiniSeriesID element, and change the value to match the MiniSeries ID. That is, ensure that MiniSeries.ID = MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID.

If the MiniSeries element isn't present and you're not going to add it, use MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle instead of MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID. MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle is used as given, without having to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a MiniSeries element. You might also consider whether this work would be more accurately tagged as a TvSpecial.

**Elements possibly involved**

MiniSeries.ID <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesID <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle <br/>

* * *

### Error: Referenced TvSeason not found {#tvseason_not_found}

**Detail message:** **_WorkID_** TvEpisode references a missing TvSeason with ID of _ss_

**Example:** **tt123456** TvEpisode references a missing TvSeason with ID of nn654321

**What went wrong**

The TvEpisode with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) specifies the ID of its TvSeason (nn654321 in the example), but there's no matching TvSeason in your catalog.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the TvSeason element to which this episode should belong. If the TvSeason is present, note its ID value. Go to the TvEpisode's entry, locate its SeasonID element, and change the value to match the TvSeason's ID. That is, ensure that TvSeason.ID = TvEpisode.SeasonID.

If the TvSeason isn't present and you're not going to add it, use TvEpisode.SeasonInShow instead of TvEpisode.SeasonID. You can also add the optional TvEpisode.SeasonTitle. TvEpisode.SeasonInShow and TvEpisode.SeasonTitle are used as given and are not required to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a TvSeason element, which only should be absent if you absolutely cannot obtain that information.

{% include note.html content="Some shows weren't released or organized by season. In those cases, instead of a TvEpisode, consider classifying the work as a TvSpecial associated with a TvShow or a MiniSeriesEpisode associated with a MiniSeries." %}

**Elements possibly involved**

TvSeason.ID<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonID<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonInShow<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonTitle<br/>

* * *

### Error: Referenced TvShow not found {#tvshow_not_found}

**Detail messages:**

_**WorkID**_ TvEpisode references a missing TvShow with ID of _ss_
_**WorkID**_ TvSpecial references a missing TvShow with ID of _ss_

**Example:** **tt123456** TvEpisode references a missing TvShow with ID of nn654321

**What went wrong**

This can happen with either a TvEpisode or a TvSpecial. The episode or special with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) specifies the ID of its TvShow (nn654321 in the example), but there's no matching TvShow in your catalog.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the TvShow element to which the episode or special should belong. If the TvShow is present, note its ID value. Go to the TvSpecial or TvEpisode entry, locate its ShowID element, and change that value to match the show's ID. That is, ensure that TvShow.ID = TvEpisode.ShowID, or TvShow.ID = TvSpecial.ShowID.

If the TvShow isn't present and you're not going to add it, use ShowTitle instead of ShowID. ShowTitle is used as given and is not required to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a TvShow element, which should raise the question of whether one should be added, or whether this work might be more accurately tagged as a TvSpecial.

**Elements possibly involved**

TvShow.ID<br/>
TvEpisode.ShowID<br/>
TvSpecial.ShowID<br/>
TvEpisode.ShowTitle<br/>
TvSpecial.ShowTitle<br/>

* * *

### Error: Title is required and cannot be blank {#title_required}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains a Title element for the given ID, it just doesn't contain the title text.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file, locate its Title element, and provide the text. Here's an example:

**Before:** `<Title locale="en-US"></Title>` <br/>
**After:** `<Title locale="en-US">City Lights</Title>`

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Title <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Error: Too many invalid images {#too_many_invalid_images}

See [Image-Related Messages](#image).

* * *

### Error: TvEpisode references an invalid SeasonID {#seasonid_invalid}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**Example:** **tt123456** TvEpisode references an invalid SeasonID

**What went wrong**

The TvEpisode with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) has a SeasonID element, but it's blank.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the TvSeason element to which this episode should belong. If it is present, note its ID value. Go to the TvEpisode's entry, locate its SeasonID element, and change the value to match the TvSeason ID. That is, ensure that TvSeason.ID = TvEpisode.SeasonID.

If the TvSeason element isn't present and you're not going to add it, use TvEpisode.SeasonInShow instead of TvEpisode.SeasonID. TvEpisode.SeasonInShow is just a number, used as given. You can also add the optional TvEpisode.SeasonTitle element, which is also used as given, without having to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a TvSeason element.

**Elements possibly involved**

TvSeason.ID<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonID<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonInSeries<br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonTitle<br/>

* * *

### Error: TvEpisode references an invalid ShowID {#showid_invalid_tvepisode}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**Example:** **tt123456** TvEpisode references an invalid ShowID

**What went wrong**

The TvEpisode with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) has a ShowID element, but it's blank.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the TvShow element to which this episode should belong. If it is present, note its ID value. Go to the TvEpisode's entry, locate its ShowID element, and change the value to match the TvShow ID. That is, ensure that TvShow.ID = TvEpisode.ShowID.

If the TvShow isn't present and you're not going to add it, use TvEpisode.ShowTitle instead of TvEpisode.ShowID. ShowTitle is used as given and is not required to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a TvShow element, which should raise the question of whether one should be added, or whether this work might be more accurately tagged as a TvSpecial.

**Elements possibly involved**

TvShow.ID <br/>
TvEpisode.ShowID <br/>
TvEpisode.ShowTitle <br/>

* * *

### Error: TvSpecial references an invalid ShowID {#showid_invalid_tvspecial}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**Example:** **tt123456** TvSpecial references an invalid ShowID

**What went wrong**

The TvSpecial with the given work ID (tt123456 in the example) has a ShowID element, but it's blank.

**What to do**

In your CDF file, find the TvShow element to which this special should belong. If it is present, note its ID value. Go to the TvSpecial's entry, locate its ShowID element, and change the value to match the TvShow ID. That is, ensure that TvShow.ID = TvSpecial.ShowID.

If the TvShow isn't present and you're not going to add it, use TvSpecial.ShowTitle instead of TvSpecial.ShowID. ShowTitle is used as given and is not required to match anything. This should be done only in the absence of a TvShow element. Note that this information is optional for a TvSpecial, so ShowID/ShowTitle can be omitted altogether.

**Elements possibly involved**

TvShow.ID <br/>
TvSpecial.ShowID <br/>
TvSpecial.ShowTitle <br/>

## Warnings {#warnings}

Warnings do not cause the catalog ingestion to fail (except image-related warnings, which can if there are enough of them), but they should be addressed as your resources allow. Deprecation warnings in particular call for attention because they tell you that the CDF schema has changed, which can result in some of your data no longer being used as before.

**Warnings**

[Aspect ratio should be between %f and %f (%f to %f preferred.)](#bad_aspect_ratio_link_warn) <br/>
[Copyright is optional but should not be blank if supplied](#copyright) <br/>
[CastMember or CrewMember name should not be blank](#credit_name) <br/>
[ExternalID is optional but should not be blank if supplied](#externalid) <br/>
[Image height must be greater than %d pixels (greater than %d pixels preferred)](#image_height_link_warn) <br/>
[Inconsistent release year information](#year) <br/>
[Invalid image](#invalid_image) <br/>
[MiniSeries is not associated with any MiniSeriesEpisodes](#miniseries) <br/>
[Possible invalid string found for optional CastMember Role element](#castmember) <br/>
[Quality element in Offer is deprecated in favor of Quality element in LaunchDetails](#quality_dep) <br/>
[ReleaseInfo element is deprecated](#releaseinfo_dep) <br/>
[Role (character name) is optional but should not be blank if supplied](#role) <br/>
[Runtime minutes is not within expected range of 1 to 2880 minutes](#minutes) <br/>
[The ShortDescription should not be the same as the Title](#shortdesc) <br/>
[The Synopsis should be longer and more descriptive than the ShortDescription](#synopsis_v_shortdesc_1) <br/>
[The Synopsis should not be the same as the ShortDescription](#synopsis_v_shortdesc_2) <br/>
[The Synopsis should not be the same as the Title](#synopsis_v_title) <br/>
[Text contains characters that are escaped more than once](#escaped_text) <br/>
[TvSeason is not associated with any TvEpisodes](#tvseason_v_episodes) <br/>
[TvShow is not associated with any TvEpisodes or TvSpecials](#tvshow_v_episodes) <br/>
[Unsupported image type. Provided image not JPG or PNG format](#unsupported_image_link) <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Aspect ratio should be between %f and %f (%f to %f preferred.) {#bad_aspect_ratio_link_warn}

See [Image-Related Messages](#image). Note that this message can appear as either a warning or a suggestion, depending on its severity.

* * *

### Warning: Copyright is optional but should not be blank if supplied {#copyright}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

The Copyright element is present under the work with the given ID, but it doesn't have the copyright information text.

**What to do**

Because the Copyright element is optional, you can delete it altogether if you don't know the copyright information. Otherwise, find the work element with the given ID in your CDF file, locate its Copyright element, and add the missing information. Here's an example:

**Before:** `<Copyright locale="en-US"></Copyright>` <br/>
**After:** `<Copyright locale="en-US">© 1894 Edison Manufacturing Company</Copyright>` <br/>

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Copyright <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: CastMember or CrewMember name should not be blank {#credit_name}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

This warning can apply to either a CastMember or a CrewMember. Your CDF file contains the Name element for the person, but it's missing the person's name.

**What to do**

Find the work element with the given ID in your CDF file. Find that work's Credits element. Look at each CastMember or CrewMember element in that Credits section, locate any with an empty Name element, and add that information. Here's an example:

**Before:** `<Name locale="en-US"></Name>`
**After:** `<Name locale="en-US">Alan Smithee</Name>`

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.CastMember.Name <br/>
_WorkType_.CrewMember.Name <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: ExternalID is optional but should not be blank if supplied {#externalid}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains an ExternalID element, but doesn't provide the information. An ExternalID is the ID assigned to a work or person by some other source such as IMDb or the UPC code on a DVD box. The ExternalID can apply to a work (Movie, TvShow, etc.), a CastMember, or a CrewMember. With an ExternalID, we can link to or pull in information from that source. For instance, for a member of the cast or crew, their IMDb ExternalID allows their picture and description to be imported.

**What to do**

Find the element with the given ID in your CDF file. Find each ExternalID element that it contains—a work can contain as many ExternalID elements as it has CrewMember or CastMember elements, plus one for the work itself. Because the ExternalID element is optional, you can delete it altogether if necessary. Otherwise, add the missing information. Here's an example for a CastMember:

```xml
<Movie>
    <ID>_WorkID_</ID>
    <ExternalID scheme="imdb">tt0029843</ExternalID>
    ...
    <Credits>
        <CastMember>
            <Name locale="en-US">Errol Flynn</Name>
            <ExternalID scheme="imdb">nm0653028</ExternalID>
```

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ExternalID <br/>
_WorkType_.CastMember.ExternalID <br/>
_WorkType_.CrewMember.ExternalID <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Image height must be greater than %d pixels (greater than %d pixels preferred) {#image_height_link_warn}

See [Image-Related Messages](#image). Note that this message can appear as either a warning or a suggestion, depending on its severity.

* * *


### Warning: Inconsistent release year information {#year}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Provided ReleaseYear _yyyy_ differs from the year _yyyy_ in the _ss_ element

Examples:

**tt123456** Provided ReleaseYear 1959 differs from the year 1960 in the OriginalAirDate element <br/>
**tt456789** Provided ReleaseYear 1977 differs from the year 1978 in the ReleaseDate element <br/>

**What went wrong**

The work specifies its release year in more than one place, but they do not agree. You've provided a ReleaseYear plus an OriginalAirDate or ReleaseDate, each of which also include a year. In tracking this down, note that there are two different ReleaseDate elements, one that's a direct child element of the work and another that's a child element of the deprecated ReleaseInfo element. ReleaseDate is found only under Movie, TvShow, and MiniSeries elements. The deprecated ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate is found in all work types. OriginalAirDate is found only under TvEpisode, TvSpecial, and MiniSeriesEpisode elements.

{% include note.html content="Do not use the deprecated ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate element in any new additions to your catalog. If your catalog predates that element's deprecation, consider updating the catalog to fit the current schema. See [ReleaseInfo element is deprecated](#releaseinfo_dep) below for instructions." %}

**What to do**

Find the element with the given WorkID (tt123456 or tt456789 in the example) in your CDF file. Find its ReleaseYear element, verify that the year is correct, and note the value. Next, find any instance of OriginalAirDate or ReleaseDate under that work and ensure that those strings include the same year. Note that OriginalAirDate and ReleaseDate have strict data forms (for example, 2003-08-08T00:00:00Z) of which the year might be only a portion.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ReleaseYear <br/>
_WorkType_.ReleaseDate <br/>
_WorkType_.ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *


### Warning: Invalid image {#invalid_image}

See [Image-Related Messages](#image).

* * *

### Warning: MiniSeries is not associated with any MiniSeriesEpisodes {#miniseries}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains an entry for a MiniSeries, but it doesn't have any episodes. This can lead to a bad user experience because they can see and select the mini-series, but then find it empty. There are two possibilities for what caused this. The first is that the MiniSeriesEpisode elements weren't included in the CDF file. The second is that those episodes are in your CDF file, but they specify the wrong mini-series.

**What to do**

Find each expected MiniSeriesEpisode element for that MiniSeries in your CDF file. Are they there?

*   **No:** You'll need to add them.
*   **Yes:** How does each identify its MiniSeries; by using the MiniSeriesID or MiniSeriesTitle element?
*   **MiniSeriesID:** Ensure that it matches the MiniSeries.ID value (the WorkID in the detail message).
*   **MiniSeriesTitle:** Ensure that it matches the MiniSeries.Title value exactly, including case.

**Possible elements involved**

MiniSeries.ID <br/>
MiniSeries.Title <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisodes.MiniSeriesID <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisodes.MiniSeriesTitle <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Possible invalid string found for optional CastMember Role element {#castmember}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Please confirm that _text_ is a valid Role (character name)

Examples:

**tt123456** Please confirm that Actor is a valid Role (character name) <br/>
**tt123456** Please confirm that Unknown is a valid Role (character name) <br/>

**What went wrong**

This warning is very specific. Currently, it only looks for values of "Unknown" or "Actor" in the CastMember.Role element. The Role element exists to supply the name of the character that the actor played in the work, such as Han Solo. Any entry under CastMember is, by definition, an actor. That said, there are rare instances where "Actor" or "Unknown" could be valid character names. In those cases, to avoid seeing this warning in every report, you might reword those entries somewhat if possible, such as "Actor #1" or "The Unknown". Note that if you include the Role element but leave it blank, you'll receive a different warning.

**What to do**

Find the work element with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its Credits section. Find any CastMember elements that it contains and locate any with "Actor" or "Unknown" in the Role element. The Role element is optional, so omit it altogether if you don't know the character's name. Otherwise, add the character name.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Credits.CastMember.Role <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Quality element in Offer is deprecated in favor of Quality element in LaunchDetails {#quality_dep}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

The CDF schema has changed, but your file still uses elements from an older schema version. In this case, as of CDF version 1.2, the Quality element for each Offer type was moved under the new Offers._OfferType_.LaunchDetails element, but is otherwise the same. Your file still places the Quality element directly under Offers._OfferType_.

**What to do**

Technically, you don't have to do anything. Your existing Quality value will continue to be used. However, in the interest of a clean ingestion report, you should update your file as your resources allow.

*   **If your CDF file is automatically generated from your media database**: The script or transform that takes the information from your database and puts it into the CDF format will need to be updated. Contact your database administrator (DBA) and tell them that the quality value should now be exported to the Offers._OfferType_.LaunchDetails.Quality element rather than to Offers._OfferType_.Quality. The DBA can consult the [Catalog Data Format (CDF) XSD](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.amazon.aftb.cdf/catalog-13.xsd) for the LaunchElement's proper placement.
*   **If your database has a structure that matches the CDF format**: Again, your DBA will need to make this change. In this case, the database itself will need to be slightly redesigned to account for the newer CDF structure.
*   **If you construct the CDF file manually**: Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its Offers element. Do the following for each offer type that currently has an Offers._OfferType_.Quality element:
1.  Add a LaunchDetails element. Location matters - it should be the last element in the SubscriptionOffer and FreeOffer types, and should be directly before the PriceType element in the PurchaseOffer and RentalOffer types.
2.  Add a Quality element under the LaunchDetails element. Specify the same value (SD, HD, or UHD) that the original element used.
3.  Delete the original Offers._OfferType_.Quality element.

Here's an example of the change:

**Before**

```xml
<Movie>
    ...
    <Offers>|
        <FreeOffer>
            <Quality>HD</Quality>
            ...
        </FreeOffer>
        ...
    </Offers>
    ...
</Movie>
```

**After**

```xml
<Movie>
    ...
    <Offers>|
        <FreeOffer>
            ....
            <LaunchDetails>
                <Quality>HD</Quality>
            </LaunchDetails>
        </FreeOffer>
        ...
    </Offers>
    ...
</Movie>
```

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Offers._OfferType_.Quality (deprecated) <br/>
_WorkType_.Offers._OfferType_.LaunchDetails.Quality <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>
_OfferType_ can be SubscriptionOffer, FreeOffer, PurchaseOffer, or RentalOffer <br/>

### Warning: ReleaseInfo element is deprecated {#releaseinfo_dep}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Please use the _ReleaseDate / OriginalAirDate / ReleaseYear_ element instead for _WorkType_

Examples:

**tt123456** Please use the ReleaseDate element instead for ShowType <br/>
**tt45678** Please use the OriginalAirDate element instead for EpisodeType

**What went wrong**

The CDF schema has changed, but your file still uses elements from an older schema version. In this case, as of CDF version 1.3, the ReleaseInfo element, which applied to all work types, is deprecated in favor of work-type-specific values. ReleaseInfo contained two child elements: ReleaseDate and ReleaseCountry. ReleaseCountry information is no longer used at all. ReleaseDate information is now stored based on the work type: ReleaseDate for the Movie, TvShow, and MiniSeries types; OriginalAirDate for TvEpisode, TvSpecial, and MiniSeriesEpisode types.

**What to do**

Technically, you don't have to do anything. Your existing ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate value will continue to be used. However, in the interest of a clean ingestion report, you should update your file as your resources allow.

*   **If your CDF file is automatically generated from your media database**: The script or transform that takes the information from your database and puts it into the CDF format will need to be updated. Contact your database administrator (DBA) and tell them the following:
    *   The work's release date, previously contained in _WorkType_.ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate, should now be exported to _WorkType_.OriginalAirDate for TvEpisode, TvSpecial, and MiniSeriesEpisode types and _WorkType_.ReleaseDate for Movie, TvShow, and MiniSeries types.
    *   The ReleaseInfo element should be removed. <br/><br/>The DBA can consult the [Catalog Data Format (CDF) XSD](https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.amazon.aftb.cdf/catalog.xsd) for details.
*   **If your database has a structure that matches the CDF format**: Again, your DBA will need to make this change. In this case, the database itself will need to be slightly redesigned to account for the newer CDF structure.
*   **If you construct the CDF file manually**: Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its ReleaseInfo element and note the ReleaseDate value.
*   **If the work type is Movie, TvShow, or MiniSeries**: Add a ReleaseDate element, including the value, as the very last thing under the work's element.
*   **if the work type is TvEpisode, TvSpecial, or MiniSeriesEpisode**: Add an OriginalAirDate element, including the value, as the very last thing under the work's element.
*   **Regardless of work type**: Remove the original ReleaseInfo element once the new elements are in place.

**Elements possibly involved**

_WorkType_.ReleaseInfo (deprecated) <br/>
_WorkType_.ReleaseInfo.ReleaseDate (deprecated) <br/>
_WorkType_.ReleaseInfo.ReleaseCountry (deprecated) <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

Movie.ReleaseDate <br/>
TvShow.ReleaseDate <br/>
MiniSeries.ReleaseDate <br/>
TvEpisode.OriginalAirDate <br/>
TvSpecial.OriginalAirDate <br/>
MiniSeriesEpisode.OriginalAirDate <br/>

### Warning: Role (character name) is optional but should not be blank if supplied {#role}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Role (character name) for _​person_ is blank

Example: **tt123456** Role (character name) for Errol Flynn is blank

**What went wrong**

The Role element is present, but it doesn't provide the information. The Role element exists to supply the name of the character that the actor played in the work, such as Han Solo.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file (tt123456 in the example). Find its Credits section. Find the CastMember element for the person in question (Errol Flynn in the example), and locate that person's Role element. Role is optional, so you can either add the character name or, if you don't know the character name, delete the Role element altogether. Do not use "Unknown" as a character name.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Credits.CastMember.Role <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Runtime minutes is not within expected range of 1 to 2880 minutes {#minutes}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Please confirm that _nn_ minutes is the correct runtime

Example: **tt123456** Please confirm that 99999999 minutes is the correct runtime

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains a RuntimeMinutes element with a value that seems unusually large or small. This warning is triggered when the value is less than 1 or greater than 2880 minutes (48 hours!). Few works would legitimately fall outside of that range. This information can be seen by the end user and so should be accurate to avoid a bad user experience.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file (tt123456 in the example). Find its RuntimeMinutes element. Make sure that the correct value is given. Because this is an optional element, you can delete the RuntimeMinutes element altogether, but for a better user experience this is not recommended.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.RuntimeMinutes <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: The ShortDescription should not be the same as the Title {#shortdesc}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

The Title and ShortDescription elements contain identical text, which is a poor user experience. The ShortDescription element is meant to hold a 2-3 line summary of the work to give the user an idea of whether that work is of interest to them. Users already know the title at that point.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its ShortDescription element. Replace the work's name in that element with a brief (2-3 lines) description of its plot or subject. The ShortDescription element is optional; if you don't have a description, you can delete it altogether, although we recommended that each work has at least a ShortDescription.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ShortDescription <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: The Synopsis should be longer and more descriptive than the ShortDescription {#synopsis_v_shortdesc_1}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

This CDF file contains both a ShortDescription and a Synopsis for this work. The Synopsis text is shorter than, but not identical to, the ShortDescription text. The Synopsis element is meant to hold a more detailed description of the work than can be given in the 2-3 line ShortDescription.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find that work's Synopsis and ShortDescription elements and compare their contents. Adding an expanded Synopsis is the ideal solution for the best user experience. However, if you don't have any further information on the work, you can omit the Synopsis as it is optional. Although it is also optional, we recommend that you supply at least a shortDescription.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ShortDescription <br/>
_WorkType_.Synopsis <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: The Synopsis should not be the same as the ShortDescription {#synopsis_v_shortdesc_2}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

This CDF file contains both a ShortDescription and a Synopsis for this work, and the two elements contain identical text. The Synopsis element is meant to hold a more detailed description of the work's content than can be given in the 2-3 line ShortDescription.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find that work's Synopsis and ShortDescription elements and compare their contents. If the ShortDescription is more than 2-3 lines, shorten it. If not, then expand the Synopsis for the best user experience. However, if you don't have any further information on the work, you can omit the Synopsis as it is optional. Although it is also optional, we recommend that you supply at least a ShortDescription.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ShortDescription <br/>
_WorkType_.Synopsis <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: The Synopsis should not be the same as the Title {#synopsis_v_title}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

The Title and Synopsis elements contain identical text, which is a poor user experience. The Synopsis element is meant to hold a summary of the content to give the user an idea of what the work is about. They already know the title by that point.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its Synopsis element. Replace the work's name in that element with a description of its plot or subject. The Synopsis element is optional, so if you don't have a description you can delete it altogether, although this is not ideal.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.Synopsis <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: Text contains characters that are escaped more than once {#escaped_text}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ _Element_ contains characters that are escaped more than once

Examples:

**tt123456** MiniSeriesTitle contains characters that are escaped more than once <br/>
**tt234567** SeasonTitle contains characters that are escaped more than once <br/>
**tt345678** ShortDescription contains characters that are escaped more than once <br/>
**tt456789** ShowTitle contains characters that are escaped more than once <br/>
**tt567890** Title contains characters that are escaped more than once <br/>

**What went wrong**

An XML serializer (possibly used in the code that pulls data from your database and converts it into the catalog XML file), has replaced the ampersand (&) in an escaped character with the escaped ampersand (&amp;). An escaped character is present in your text as a code entity; for example, _&bull;_ for an em-dash, and _&amp;_ for an ampersand. The serializer did not expect escaped characters and dealt with them as plain text, escaping all ampersands. This results in "&bull;" becoming "&amp;mdash;" and displaying as "&bull;_"_. The string "this &amp; that", which you expect to render as "this & that", becomes "this &amp;amp; that", which displays as "this &amp; that".

**What to do**

In both your CDF file and in your source database, find the work with the given ID and then its text element as specified in the detail message (Title, ShowTitle, SeasonTitle, ShortDescription, or MiniSeriesTitle). If the doubly-escaped characters are only present in your catalog file, the problem lies in the transformation when the catalog file is created. Use non-escaped characters in the original text whenever possible. You might also be able to instruct the serializer to expect an escaped string so that it properly recognizes those characters.

**Possible elements involved**

MiniSeriesEpisode.MiniSeriesTitle <br/>
TvEpisode.SeasonTitle <br/>
TvEpisode.ShowTitle <br/>
TvSeason.ShowTitle <br/>
TvSpecial.ShowTitle <br/>
_WorkType_.ShortDescription <br/>
_WorkType_.Title <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Warning: TvSeason is not associated with any TvEpisodes {#tvseason_v_episodes}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains an entry for a TvSeason, but it doesn't have any episodes. This can lead to a bad user experience because they can see and select the season, but then find it empty. There are two primary possibilities for what caused this. The first is that the TvEpisode elements weren't included in the CDF file. The second is that those episodes are in your CDF file, but they specify the wrong season.

**What to do**

Find each expected TvEpisode element for that season in your CDF file. Are they there?

*   **No:** You'll need to add them.
*   **Yes:** How does each identify its season; by using the SeasonID or SeasonInShow element?
*   **SeasonID:** Ensure that it matches the TvSeason.ID value (the WorkID in the detail message).
*   **SeasonInShow:** Ensure that it matches the TvSeason.SeasonInShow value.

**Possible elements involved**

TvSeason.ID <br />
TvEpisode.SeasonTitle <br />
TvEpisode.SeasonID <br />
TvEpisode.SeasonInShow <br />

* * *

### Warning: TvShow is not associated with any TvEpisodes or TvSpecials {#tvshow_v_episodes}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What went wrong**

Your CDF file contains an entry for a TvShow, but it doesn't have any episodes. This can lead to a bad user experience because they can see and select the show, but then find it empty. There are two primary possibilities for what caused this. The first is that the TvEpisode elements weren't included in the CDF file. The second is that those episodes are in your CDF file, but they specify the wrong show.

**What to do**

Find each expected TvEpisode element for that show in your CDF file. Are they there?

*   **No:** You'll need to add them.
*   **Yes:** How does each identify its show; by using the ShowID or ShowTitle element?
*   **ShowID:** Ensure that it matches the TvShow.ID value (the WorkID in the detail message).
*   **ShowTitle:** Ensure that it matches the TvShow.Title value exactly, including case.

**Possible elements involved**

TvShow.ID <br/>
TvShow.Title <br/>
TvEpisode.ShowID <br/>
TvEpisode.ShowTitle <br/>

### Suggestion: Invalid image {#no_image}

See [Image-Related Messages](#image).

* * *

### Suggestion: Provide cast and crew information for better search and browse integration {#cast_and_crew}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What to do**

In your CDF file, this work does not include any cast or crew information. Including this information can make the work easier to find by the user. For instance, the user might want to search for movies that feature the actor Humphrey Bogart, or films directed by Akira Kurosawa. Without at least basic cast and crew information, the work can only be found by searching for its title or coming across it while browsing.

**Elements involved**

_WorkType_.Credits.CastMember <br/>
_WorkType_.Credits.CrewMember <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra<br/.

* * *

### Suggestion: Provide only one _ShortDescription/Synopsis_ per locale {#one_per_locale}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ There is more than one _ShortDescription/Synopsis_ with locale of _ss_

**Examples**

_**WorkID**_ There is more than one ShortDescription with locale of en-us <br/>
_**WorkID**_ There is more than one Synopsis with locale of fr <br/>

**What to do**

Your CDF file contains either multiple entries with the same locale under ShortDescription, multiple entries with the same locale under Synopsis, or both. For a given locale, only one ShortDescription and one Synopsis can be used. Find the work with the given ID in your CDF file. Find its ShortDescription element. If the ShortDescription contains multiple entries, find any with the same locale value. Remove entries as needed to leave a single entry with that locale. Repeat the procedure for the Synopsis element.

**Elements involved**

_WorkType_.ShortDescription <br/>
_WorkType_.Synopsis <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

* * *

### Suggestion: Provide the Count for CustomerRating for better data quality and user experience {#count_for_customerrating}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_

**What to do**

The CustomerRating entry in your CDF file has the option of a Count element. Count is intended to state the number of customers who rated the work. Higher numbers give a rating more credibility, as they tend to balance out the skew that can result from a low sample set. You would need to track that information and update the Count and CustomerRating values each time you update your catalog.

**Elements involved**

_WorkType_.CustomerRating.Count <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

## Image-Related Messages {#image}

Errors, warnings, and suggestions that concern images interact in a way that the other messages do not. Normally, warnings and suggestions do not cause your catalog to be rejected. However, image-related warnings and suggestions in over 50% of your entries trigger the [Too many invalid images](#too_many_invalid_images) error, which does cause a catalog rejection.

Many image issues aren't a problem with the CDF file itself, but rather a problem with one or more images that it references. Solving some image issues can involve graphic design, image editing, or server access rights. You might need to reach out to your graphics or IT department to help you solve these problems.

**Error-related messages**

[Error: Too many invalid images](#too_many_invalid_images_2) <br/>
[Warning: Aspect ratio should be between 1:3 and 3:1 (1:2 to 2:1 preferred.)](#bad_aspect_ratio) <br/>

### Error: Too many invalid images {#too_many_invalid_images_2}

**Detail message: **_nn_% invalid images or fewer allowed; _nn_% found. See the warnings and suggestions section for details.

**What went wrong**

A small number of invalid images (missing or unusable) do not cause an ingestion failure—you'll only see warnings and suggestions in that case. However, enough invalid images were found in this catalog to cause a failure. The threshold is approximately 50%. Note that the lack of an image for a work is considered an invalid image, so at least 50% of the works in your catalog must include valid images.

**What to do**

Refer to the Warnings and Suggestions sections of the ingestion report for the specific image-related issues encountered in the ingestion. Find and correct any instances of those warnings and suggestions that you find in the report.

**Elements involved**

### Warning/Suggestion: Aspect ratio should be between 1:3 and 3:1 (1:2 to 2:1 preferred.) {#bad_aspect_ratio}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Unsupported aspect ratio _nn_ for image _url_. Please provide acceptably sized image.

**What went wrong**

This is not a problem with your CDF file; it is a problem with an image that it references. The image exceeds our current height-to-width ratio requirements, which is to say that it's either too skinny or too flat.

**What you need to know**

We want a width-to-height ratio between 1:2 and 2:1. If your image is between 1:3 and 3:1, we crop it to 1:2 or 2:1 and this message appears as a suggestion. However, if the cropping causes the image height to drop below 240 pixels, the image won't be used.

If your image is outside of 1:3 to 3:1, this message appears as a warning and the image counts toward the total number of invalid images, which can lead to the catalog being rejected.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID (tt123456 in the example) in your CDF file. Find the ImageUrl tag that it contains. This URL tells you where the image file is located. Provide that URL to your graphics department and let them know that you need the image to have a width-to-height ratio between at least 1:3 and 3:1 (1:2 and 2:1 to avoid cropping), while ensuring that the height is no less than 480 pixels, even after cropping. Once you have a corrected image, ensure that its URL hasn't changed. If it has, update the ImageUrl value in your CDF file.

**Possible elements involved**

### Warning: Image height must be greater than 240 pixels (greater than 480 pixels preferred) {#image_height}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Image height _nn_ is below acceptance criteria for _url_. Please provide acceptably sized image.

**What went wrong**

This is not a problem with your CDF file, but rather a problem with an image that it references. The image referenced by the work has a proper width-to-height ratio, but it is shorter than the required 480 pixels high. We prefer a height of at least 480 pixels. If your image height is between 240 and 480 pixels, this message appears as a suggestion. If your image height is below 240 pixels, this message appears as a warning and the image counts toward the total number of invalid images, which can lead to the catalog being rejected.

**What to do**

Find the element with the given ID in your CDF file. Find the ImageUrl tag that it contains. This URL tells you where the image file is located. Provide that URL to your graphics department and let them know that the image height should be no less than 240 pixels (480 pixels or more preferred) while ensuring that the image retains a width-to-height ratio between 1:3 or 3:1 (between 1:2 and 2:1 to avoid cropping). Once you have a corrected image, ensure that its URL hasn't changed. If it has, update the ImageUrl value in your CDF file.

### Warning: Invalid image {#http_empty}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ We were unable to retrieve an image from _url_. The HTTP response was empty.

**What went wrong**

The request to provide the image was made to the server where the image is stored, but, while the response code indicated success, the response contained no headers or body, and no image.

**What to do**

This is not a problem with the CDF file, but rather a server communication problem. If the problem persists in subsequent reports, find the work with the given ID in your CDF file and find its ImageUrl tag. Provide the URL to your IT department, let them know that retrieval requests for the image are coming back empty, and ask them to investigate.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ImageUrl <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

### Warning: Invalid image {#http_closed}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ We were unable to retrieve an image from _url_. The HTTP response was unexpectedly closed.

**What went wrong**

The request to provide the image was made to the server where the image is stored, but the server connection closed unexpectedly and the image could not be retreived.

**What to do**

This is not a problem with the CDF file, but rather a server communication problem. In this case, wait for the next report to try to reproduce the issue, which might very well be a one-time problem. If the image request continues to return this warning, provide the image file's URL to your IT department and let them know that the system is repeatedly not responding to a retrieval request with a valid HTTP response. They should be able to further investigate based on that information.

**Possible elements involved**

### Warning: Invalid image {#response_invalid}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ We were unable to retrieve an image from _url_. The HTTP response was invalid.

**What went wrong**

The request to provide the image was made to the server where the image is stored, but the response message that came back was garbled in some way.

**What to do**

This is not a problem with the CDF file, but rather a server communication problem. In this case, you might wait for the next report to see if it replicates; it's entirely possible that it was a one-time problem. If the image request continues to return this warning, provide the image file's URL to your IT department and let them know that the system is repeatedly not responding to a retrieval request with a valid HTTP response. They should be able to further investigate based on that information.

### Warning: Invalid image {#http_response}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ We were unable to retrieve an image from _url_. The HTTP response was _status code:_ _reason_.

**What went wrong**

The request to provide the image was made to the server where the image is stored, but the response code indicated a problem and did not return an image.

**What to do**

This is not a problem with the CDF file, but rather a server communication problem. Provide the image file's URL and the response's status code and reason to your IT department. They should be able to further investigate based on that information. The problem could lie with an invalid request, a server accessibility or firewall issue, a payload size issue, an offline server, or any number of things.

### Warning: Unsupported image type. Provided image not JPG or PNG format. {#unsupported_image}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ Unsupported image type _ext_ for _url_. Images should be in JPG or PNG format.

**What went wrong**

The CDF file has specified an image file with a format other than JPG or PNG.

**What to do**

Find the work with the given ID in the CDF file. Find its ImageUrl element. This URL specifies the image file location. You might need to contact your graphics department to have the image converted to a supported format (JPG or PNG), or you can do it yourself by opening the file in a graphics program and saving it as one of the supported types. Some file type conversions can degrade the image, so compare the original and new versions to ensure that the new image is still acceptable. Replace the image on the server with the new version. You might need to update the ImageUrl element in the CDF file to match the new image name.

**Possible elements involved**

_WorkType_.ImageUrl <br/>
_WorkType_ can be Movie, TvShow, TvSeason, TvEpisode, TvSpecial, MiniSeries, MiniSeriesEpisode, or Extra <br/>

### Suggestion: Invalid Image {#no_image_provided}

**Detail message:** _**WorkID**_ No image present for item. Please provide image if available.

**What went wrong**

The CDF file does not specify an image for this work.

**What to do**

While ImageUrl is optional for any given work, at least 50% of your work entries must provide a valid image through that element. Failure to do so causes the [Too many invalid images](#too_many_invalid_images_2) error to be triggered, which causes your uploaded catalog to be rejected. If you are above the 50% threshold and do not include an image for a work, we will attempt to use an external source for the image, such as IMDb. This requires that you include enough information about the work to allow us to match it to that external source. For lack of any other image, we will provide a generic placeholder, but that is a less than ideal user experience.
